Shape Shooter is an arcade styled top-down shooter heavily inspired by games like Smash TV. The basic mechanics of the
game is to eliminate enemies by shooting from various weapons while dodging enemy attacks. Each elimination results in
one point added to your final score, but the enemies get faster and spawn more frequently the more points you acquire.

Early into development, Shape Shooter was originally going to be called Gopher Shooter and be designed around the
infamous Gopher Project that Dr. Alisafaee was supervising. The game was going to have the troll enemies be different
variants of a standard gopher enemy, the weapons were going to be different kinds of Rose Hulman themed weapons, and
the player was going to be a picture of Dr. Alisafaee. Eventually, it was decided that due to time constraints that the
theme of the project would change from shooting gophers to shooting shapes.
